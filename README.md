Configuration Managament is critically important for working in teams, for developing multiplatform software, tracking contribution to the project, and often useful for general tracking and organizational purposes. Configuration Management allows you to represent features as changes to a repository and provides tools for combining changes from other developers. There are four primary members of the software configuration management process: the Configuration Manager, the Developer, the Auditor, and the Project Manager. Users may need to interact with the software configuration management system in order to keep their packages updated. 

Configuration Management is broadly used in industry and reflects positively on developers who's contributions can be traced through publicly available repositories. High profile open source projects would be borderline impossible without Configuration Management Systems. Contributing to such projects can show employers that you've had experience working in complex projects using systems and programs that their organization likely works with or has analogs of. Personal repositories are important too, and good candidates for these include websites, games mobile apps, and scripts. If you're trying to get hired at one place in particular it could be helpful to actually use one of the companies APIs or services in a repository to demonstrate familiarity. Your goal with public repositories is principally to impress other engineers who may interview you. Finally one of the most significant things a repository can prove is that you're familiar with programming and aren't just stuck in the theory. Essentially by having a publicly available list of repositories you can show you walk the walk and don't just talk the talk.
